# Training Data Eigenvector Dynamics in the EigenPro 3 Implementation of the NTK and RFM
Code for "Training Data Eigenvector Dynamics in the EigenPro 3 Implementation of the Neural Tangent Kernel and Recursive Feature Machines" at ICLR 2023.
EigenPro 3 is required and can be installed at the [repository](https://github.com/EigenPro/EigenPro3/).
Based on the original RFM code found [here](https://github.com/aradha/recursive_feature_machines/).
